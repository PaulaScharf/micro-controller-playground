# Hand Recognition and Camera Webserver
The Hand recognition code comes from this [blog post](https://blog.espressif.com/hand-gesture-recognition-on-esp32-s3-with-esp-deep-learning-176d7e13fd37) and [github repo](https://github.com/alibukharai/Blogs/tree/main/ESP-DL).
The Camera Webserver Code comes from this [tutorial](https://esp32tutorials.com/esp32-cam-esp-idf-live-streaming-web-server/).

The hand recognition model should be replacable with custom models. I am not entirely sure, what input is currently expected for the hand recognition model. In the github repo there was an example image, but it looks very different from the values, that our camera captures.
